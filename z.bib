	Abstract = {Zeeguu is a language learning platform, that allows people to
		extend their vocabulary and language skills by reading any text
		they like. Additionally, it provides feedback on the progress
		and exercises to further improve the aquired knowledge. This
		thesis introduces the Zeeguu Reader, a mobile application for
		Android that uses RSS feeds to automatically provide the user
		with the newest articles from the news sources or blogs he
		subscribes to, while supporting the user with translations and
		keeping track of his reading progress. Its features include an
		article recommender that tries to automatically select the
		articles that fit best to the user's current language level. For
		the RSS part, the application uses the Feedly Cloud1, which
		synchronizes the subscrip- tions and reading progress between
		different devices and allows the user to continue reading where
		he left on any computer in the Feedly web interface and keep
		learning the language with the Zeeguu Chrome plugin.},

@techreport{Gieh15a,
	Abstract = {Zeeguu is a user based learning platform which enables the
	user to expand his vocabulary and receive feedback about his progress
	while he is reading about topics he loves. To reach the best efficiency
	possible, the user should be able to access the Platform from as many devices
	as possible, all connected with one single account. This way Zeeguu supports
	the user when he is reading foreign languages, monitors his progress of those
	languages and gives him further possibilities to improve the language
	everywhere and at any time. This paper introduces an Android application as an
	extension for the Zeeguu ecosystem and since Android is the leading mobile
	operating system, this work represents an important step towards getting
	Zeeguu into the daily life of the users.},
