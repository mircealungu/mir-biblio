Wible et al. [34] also developed two browser based tools, Collocator and WordSpider, which annotated L2 Web pages by highlighting word collocations and provided in-page L2 contextual word clues respectively

vocabulary for second language learners. Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, 2001, pp. 127-128.

What makes graded-reader unique is the way in which it chooses what words and phrases to translate. Tauber approached the problem algorithmically with the goal of ordering the vocabulary presented to the learner in such a way that it maximizes the learner’s ability to read a corpus.

### Live Wallpaper
Dearman and Truong propose a 'live wallpaper' interface that is always visible to the user when he is using his phone. They also present words in context.

### Augmenting the L1 Web with Random L2 words
Augment the web in L1 with translations of a fixed set of words in L2. 
Two month deployment, 18 participants, learned in average 50 new words.

The fact that an extra month of using ALOE did not significantly improve participants’ vocabulary is likely related to the decrease in participant interactions during the second month. Because the participants encountered the same set of words repeatedly, even after they had already learned the words, they had far fewer opportunities to learn new words.

Good related work on augmenting the web. 

Interesting: 
- The decrease in interactions is probably due to the static nature of the set of words being translated
- Few of the multiple choice interactions resulted in participants actually answering

Methodology Hint - 'formative interviews' with six language educators that agreed that big challenge is motivating students to continue studying outside of class hours.

### Ubiquitous Language Learning with Mobile Phone and TV
Listening skills can be practiced via television, including recognizing nd understanding. 
Disadvantage of TV broadcast is its 'non-interruptible quality'
Uses pre-recorded materials and a strange device. 
Review recommended words prior to showtime.
Paper describes in detail the architecture of the system.

Methodology: 
- usability score 
- usefulness 
- desirability -- some cards being selected
- overall acceptance
