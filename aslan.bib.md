    - Motivational variables contribute to reading achievement and text comprehension through several paths.
    - Study 1 also showed that reading motivation significantly predicted reading amount 
    - Study 2 showed that reading amount significantly predicted text comprehension with other variables controlled. Further, motivation predicted reading amount with other variables controlled and directly predicted text comprehension.

# Importance of Reading

Reading has the potential to improve the other skills by being a training ground for them: writing, listening, and speaking:

        @article{mccarthy1999-microcosm,
          title={Reading theory as a microcosm of the four skills},
          author={McCarthy, C},
          journal={The Internet TESL Journal},
          volume={5},
          number={5},
          pages={1--6},
          year={1999}
        }

Reading is more influential in writing style than writing or direct instruction: 

        @article{krashen1993-smarter,
          title={We learn to write by reading, but writing can make you smarter},
          author={Krashen, Stephen},
          journal={Ilha do Desterro A Journal of English Language, Literatures in English and Cultural Studies},
          number={29},
          pages={027--038},
          year={1993}
        }

Reading improves the writing of both beginners and advanced: 

        @book{grabe2014-theory,
          title={Theory and practice of writing: An applied linguistic perspective},
          author={Grabe, William and Kaplan, Robert B},
          year={2014},
          publisher={Routledge}
        }

Reading has a positive effect on developing compositional skills: 

        @book{ferris2004-composition,
          title={Teaching ESL composition: Purpose, process, and practice},
          author={Ferris, Dana R and Hedgcock, John},
          year={2004},
          publisher={Routledge}
        }

Nice summary of the advantages of reading, together with recommendations: 

        @article{mccarthy1999-extensive,

    }


A brief, very readable introduction to extensive reading.

The importance of context in vocabulary learning is evident from two common-sense observations: What a word means often depends on the context in which it is used, and people pick up much of their vocabulary knowledge from context, apart from explicit instruction. In this report, I will explain how the available evidence supports a relatively strong version of each of these observations, and discuss some of the instructional implications of this evidence.


    @article{New07-subtitles,
      title={The use of film subtitles to estimate word frequencies},
      author={New, Boris and Brysbaert, Marc and Veronis, Jean and Pallier, Christophe},
      journal={Applied psycholinguistics},
      volume={28},
      number={4},
      pages={661--677},
      year={2007},
      publisher={Cambridge University Press}
    }

Movie subtitles are highly representative for the spoken vocabulary.


        @article{Hirsh92-vocab-size,
            title = "What Vocabulary Size is Needed to Read Unsimplified Texts for Pleasure?",
            journal = "Reading in a Foreign Language",
            volume = "8",
            number = "2",
            pages = "689 -- 696",
            year = "1992",
            author = "David Hirsh and Paul Nation"
        }

Even when one knows 95 percent of the words in a text, they still need to lookup a word every two lines in average.

Bridging the gaps of comprehension.

To give the user the freedom (or at least a degree of freedom) of choice in
what kind of associations to assign to the text he or she is reading provides a new quality of information, or comprehension assistance service. 

Evaluation: MetaMorpho has been tested for English-Hungarian translation, and showed very promising results both in translation quality and speed.

- learners can successfully integrate L2 input into their knowledge system, provided they apperceive and comprehend it
- Hulstijn (1993) puts forward the ‘mental effort’ hypothesis, which claims that the greater the mental effort required by inferring, the better information recall and retention can be achieved.

- Gymn\@zilla
- Such an approach makes use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to elaborate authentic documents2
- possible, for example, to link an L2- document to an electronic dictionary
- access translations of words and phrases in one click
- The bookmarks have been assembled by the developers of Gymn@zilla and can be completed by language teachers.
- Mirroring of web pages is handled internally by WGET. Before downloading a web-page, it checks whether the web- page has been updated relative to a cached version.
- build up a background corpus of documents seen by a specific learner
- When the learner queries a page, Gymn@zilla returns the almost original HTML-document. The annotations added by Gymn@zilla are first invisible. Before clicking on words to get a translation, the user may explore new L2 words.
- If only a few occurrences of a word show up, a background corpus might return additional examples from the documents the learner has seen before.

- People spend large amount of time browsing the Web while fulfilling various needs, but they find it difficult to spare some time for education. We believe that the time spent by browsing can be used more efficiently. We proposed a method for web augmentation during casual web browsing, which facilitates foreign language vocabulary learning. Our method substitutes words on a web page for their foreign equivalents and exposes a user to unknown words. We conducted a small qualitative experiment to study how users perceive word substitution in web pages and how it affects their foreign language vocabulary. Results showed that web page augmentation improves user’s vocabulary size without negatively affecting his browsing experience.
- have conducted small supervised experiment to evaluate effect of text
augmentation of reading speed. The results show that augmented webpage slows
reading speed down on average by approximately 7%





Teachers have found beneficial results from allowing their students compile and study personalized corpora

Augment the web in L1 with translations of a fixed set of words in L2. 
Two month deployment, 18 participants, learned in average 50 new words.

The fact that an extra month of using ALOE did not significantly improve participants’ vocabulary is likely related to the decrease in participant interactions during the second month. Because the participants encountered the same set of words repeatedly, even after they had already learned the words, they had far fewer opportunities to learn new words.

Good related work on augmenting the web. 

Interesting: 
- The decrease in interactions is probably due to the static nature of the set of words being translated
- Few of the multiple choice interactions resulted in participants actually answering

Methodology Hint - 'formative interviews' with six language educators that agreed that big challenge is motivating students to continue studying outside of class hours.

### Contextual Microlearning
Abstract: 
Learning a new language is hard, but learning to use it confidently in conversations with native speakers is even harder. From our field research with language learners, with support from Cognitive Psychology and Second Language Acquisition, we argue for the value of contextual microlearning in the many breaks spread across different places and throughout the day. We present a mobile application that supports such microlearning by leveraging the location-based service Foursquare to automatically provide contextually relevant content in the world's major cities. In an evaluation of Mandarin Chinese learning, a four-week, 23-user study spanning Beijing and Shanghai compared this contextual system to a system based on word frequency. Study sessions with the contextual version lasted half as long but occurred in twice as many places as sessions with the frequency version, suggesting a complementary relationship between the two approaches.

### Building Blocks for Online Language Practice Platforms

This thesis describes the process of designing and implementing a family of interactive exercises, with the aid of relevant research from the field of linguistics. The author of this work has chosen a way of implemen- tation, the reasons for which will be described in this paper, along with the chosen architecture. Furthermore, this work also aims to illustrate how the selected approach provides the family of exercises with flexibility and maintainability, including the re-usage of their building blocks to con- struct new exercises. Finally, the paper will present how the evaluation of these exercises by more than one hundred users proved the project’s usability.
