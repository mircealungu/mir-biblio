# Importance of Reading

Reading has the potential to improve the other skills by being a training ground for them: writing, listening, and speaking:

        @article{mccarthy1999-microcosm,
          title={Reading theory as a microcosm of the four skills},
          author={McCarthy, C},
          journal={The Internet TESL Journal},
          volume={5},
          number={5},
          pages={1--6},
          year={1999}
        }

Reading is more influential in writing style than writing or direct instruction: 

        @article{krashen1993-smarter,
          title={We learn to write by reading, but writing can make you smarter},
          author={Krashen, Stephen},
          journal={Ilha do Desterro A Journal of English Language, Literatures in English and Cultural Studies},
          number={29},
          pages={027--038},
          year={1993}
        }

Reading improves the writing of both beginners and advanced: 

        @book{grabe2014-theory,
          title={Theory and practice of writing: An applied linguistic perspective},
          author={Grabe, William and Kaplan, Robert B},
          year={2014},
          publisher={Routledge}
        }

Reading has a positive effect on developing compositional skills: 

        @book{ferris2004-composition,
          title={Teaching ESL composition: Purpose, process, and practice},
          author={Ferris, Dana R and Hedgcock, John},
          year={2004},
          publisher={Routledge}
        }

Nice summary of the advantages of reading, together with recommendations: 

        @article{mccarthy1999-extensive,
          title={Extensive Reading: Why? and How?},
          author={Bell, Timothy},
          journal={The Internet TESL Journal},
          volume={4},
          number={12},
          pages={1--6},
          year={1999},
          url = {http://iteslj.org/Articles/Bell-Reading.html}
        }

A brief, very readable introduction to extensive reading. 
Contains also case study, but much too weak to be relevant.

    @article{atilgan13-effects,
      title={Effects of extensive reading on writing in terms of vocabulary},
      author={Atilgan, Aylin Baris},
      journal={INTESOL Journal},
      volume={10},
      number={1},
      year={2013}
    }



A discussion on the empirical support for extensive reading and its pedagogical applications in L2/FL learning. Argues that the benefits derived from diverse studies on extensive reading in many different contexts are so compelling that it will be inconceivable for teachers not to make it an important feature of their teaching

### Augmenting the L1 Web with Random L2 words
Augment the web in L1 with translations of a fixed set of words in L2. 
Two month deployment, 18 participants, learned in average 50 new words.

The fact that an extra month of using ALOE did not significantly improve participants’ vocabulary is likely related to the decrease in participant interactions during the second month. Because the participants encountered the same set of words repeatedly, even after they had already learned the words, they had far fewer opportunities to learn new words.

Good related work on augmenting the web. 

Interesting: 
- The decrease in interactions is probably due to the static nature of the set of words being translated
- Few of the multiple choice interactions resulted in participants actually answering

Methodology Hint - 'formative interviews' with six language educators that agreed that big challenge is motivating students to continue studying outside of class hours.

### Contextual Microlearning
Abstract: 
Learning a new language is hard, but learning to use it confidently in conversations with native speakers is even harder. From our field research with language learners, with support from Cognitive Psychology and Second Language Acquisition, we argue for the value of contextual microlearning in the many breaks spread across different places and throughout the day. We present a mobile application that supports such microlearning by leveraging the location-based service Foursquare to automatically provide contextually relevant content in the world's major cities. In an evaluation of Mandarin Chinese learning, a four-week, 23-user study spanning Beijing and Shanghai compared this contextual system to a system based on word frequency. Study sessions with the contextual version lasted half as long but occurred in twice as many places as sessions with the frequency version, suggesting a complementary relationship between the two approaches.
