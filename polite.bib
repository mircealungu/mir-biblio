### Empirical Investigation in PL Syntax

For both programmers and non-programmers, the conditional constructs
of Smalltalk are not intuitive.

## Deltatalk - an Empirically and Aesthetically Motivated Simplification of ST-80

The overall spirit of this paper is to identify small (i.e. “delta”) changes from the current Smalltalk-80 system, where there is some genuine evidence that the change might be beneficial. We have pruned our set of recommendations to ensure that they are mutually compatible, and have
